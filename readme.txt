Because of the complexity of the project, we try to provide complete algorithm code. The algorithm is MATLAB code, which reconstructs DBT images through iterative algorithms.

The original reconstructed image size is 1920*2304*100 (double in MATLAB), and the data file size is about 3Gb. We downsampled the image to 1/16 of the original, and the size of the data after downsampling was 480*576*100. The original projection data size is 480*576*21.

In terms of research data, we provide one set of simulated data and two sets of human breast data. The two sets of data consists of human breast data and simulated surgical needle data or simulated calcification data. We simulate as many high-density object morphologies as possible to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.

reconstuct data is under master branch
